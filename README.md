# Pokemon-Analysis
Analysis on Pokemon stuff

Reading of a file into a dataframe, filtering some aspects of this dataframe for other things(final evolutions, for example). 

Dataframes can then be used for slicing however you'd like, just have to do modifications or pretty simplistic queries. 
Some examples of what can be done are in the code already, and different dataframes are made for each type of Pokemon.

An IV Calculator without a GUI is also included here, but is commented out because it's not the main purpose of the code.
